# sentence-patterns-tool-CN
Mandarin grammar tool for building fluency in sentence pattern construction and recognition in new learners.

# LINGUISTICS
Dell Hymes introduced the concept of strategic competence in language: the ability to communicate despite gaps in vocabulary or grammar. The most relevant method that Hymes wrote about was periphrasis: when a speaker's proficiency level prevents inflection or efficiency, they could use a larger amount of words to communicate the same concept- the same thing dictionaries do. A learner who does not know the word “prefer” can still say, “I like this more than that.” They can communicate the same idea, even if it's verbose or sounds non-native.

However, strategic competence still depends on something deeper: access to productive sentence structures. Rephrasing is only possible if the speaker can reliably identify and construct the correct grammatical patterns to begin with. For many learners, this becomes the primary bottleneck. Comparisons, conditionals, and relative clauses are all examples of sentence structures that vary wildly between languages, and even if you know the necessary vocabulary, using the wrong sentence structure will make a sentence completely ambiguous to a native speaker.

For example, a Chinese person might try to tell you "This one movie more that one make me happy", mirroring the Chinese sentence structure "这个电影比那个让我开心", and vice-versa. Teaching a learner how to express "more-than" would make this concept much more communicable without heavy inference on the listener's part. The sooner the correct pattern is acquired, the sooner we can break the last major blocker to reliable communication.

This project is based on the idea of a structural threshold: the absolute minimum set of sentence patterns and supporting vocabulary that allows a learner to express nearly any everyday idea, even if imperfectly- again, the goal here is communication and understanding, first and foremost. There's no true linguistic term for this, so I'll refer to this threshold as Basal Fluency- the lowest level at which a learner can consistently produce a desired meaning without a blockage stemming from the language's fundamental features. They may have limited vocabulary and elementary grammar, but the idea is ultimately communicable. From a computer science perspective, this resembles Turing-completeness: once a system has a sufficient set of primitives, it can theoretically generate any intended output. Likewise, once a learner has sufficient vocabulary and sentence structure, they can generate any intended propositions.

# PROBLEM
I want to focus on the sentence structure, as this does most of the heavy lifting of basal fluency. Someone who knows 10,000 words but cannot reliably construct the necessary sentence structures will struggle to actually communicate. In contrast, someone who has learned 1,000 words and has a strong structural understanding can express a wide range of ideas through the use of strategic competence, as noted earlier.

Modern language learning tools are heavily targeted towards vocabulary acquisition. Spaced repetition systems are common, expansive, and widely known. Finding supplementary tools for reliably acquiring foundational grammar can be much more difficult, across a wide range of languages, despite its equal importance for applied language use.

Grammar acquisition is most commonly acquired from two methods: textbooks or passive exposure. But textbooks are not easily accessible, and they tend to emphasize rule explanation instead of actual acquisition and, therefore, production ability. Exposure-based systems avoid heavy theory, but without a good way to deliberately target and isolate the correct sentence patterns, learners continue to accumulate vocabulary before developing their structural fluency.

This creates a common bottleneck: learners either understand grammar rules from a high-level,  theoretical standpoint, or not at all, and therefore cannot reliably produce or understand otherwise simple phrases when needed. The true problem here is a lack of directed practice of the patterns themselves.

# SOLUTION
This project provides a supplementary tool focused on deliberate training in the grammatical patterns of Simplified Mandarin Chinese. Rather than treating grammar as a set of rules to study, the system isolates common and critical sentence patterns as reusable, predictable templates. Each exercise presents the user with a simple English phrase. The user will then be asked to translate the English sentence into Chinese, with the appropriate structural pattern.

Exercises are generated by combining a defined sentence pattern (e.g., comparisons, conditionals, sequencing) with random vocabulary sets to fill in context. This keeps the focus on the grammar point itself as opposed to just memorizing entire sentences on flashcards. The system will then evaluate whether the user’s response matches the correct word order.

To prevent vocabulary from becoming a bottleneck, cards are displayed on-screen in Hanzi and Pinyin, alongside their English translation. This allows users to strictly focus on the grammar, without being blocked by a lack of arbitrary vocabulary. This provides the added benefit of passively exposing the user to a wide range of vocabulary without detracting from the goal of the app. By repeatedly practicing the same structural template across varied contexts, learners build automaticity in sentence construction. The objective is to strengthen structural retrieval until it becomes reflexive, bringing the learner closer to Basal Fluency.
